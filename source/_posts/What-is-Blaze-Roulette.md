# What is Blaze Roulette?

Created by YouTube content creator "The Elusive" in February of 2017, Blaze Roulette is a variation of the popular game Russian Roulette that replaces traditional ammunition with fireballs. The game is played by two or more players, each taking turns selecting one of six numbered fireballs. One of the fireballs is then randomly selected to be set alight and the player must then catch it in their mouth. The first player to lose all their health or drop the fireball loses the game.

Blaze Roulette has quickly become a popular game on YouTube and social media, with many content creators creating videos of themselves playing the game. The game has also been featured on several TV shows, including talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! and American reality show Mythbusters.

# How to Play Blaze Roulette

To play Blaze Roulette, you will need six numbered fireballs and a container to hold them. You can either use a bowl or make a simple stand out of two sticks propped up against each other like this: 

__   
 / \__   ( Position 6 )
 /_____\__ ( Position 1 )
Fireball positions: 


Player 1 stands at position 1 and player 2 stands at position 6. Player 1 picks up a ball and either player 2 or 3 sets it on fire. Player 1 than has to catch it in their mouth and say "Blaze". If they catch it they go to the back of the line, if they don't catch it then they are out of the game. Player 2 does the same thing with ball 4-5. Once both players have had a turn, player 1 goes back to position 1 and player 2 goes to position 6 and so on… The last player left wins!

# How do you play Blaze Roulette?

Blaze Roulette is a game that is played with a deck of cards. The object of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player who gets closest to 21, without going over, wins the game.

To play Blaze Roulette, you need a deck of cards and two players. Shuffle the deck and deal out five cards face down to each player. Turn one card over for each player. This is the player's first card. The face up card on the table is the dealer's first card.

The players then take turns drawing another card from the deck and adding it to their hand. If the total of the player's cards is higher than the dealer's first card, the player takes another turn. If the total of the player's cards is lower than or equal to the dealer's first card, the player loses and forfeits all their cards. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over.

If both players have cards of the same value, for example two kings, then both players draw another card from the deck and compare their new totals. The player with the highest total wins and takes all of the other player's cards. If there is still a tie, both players draw another card and compare totals again. The process continues until there is a clear winner.

The winning player(s) gather up all of the cards and reshuffle them to start a new game.
