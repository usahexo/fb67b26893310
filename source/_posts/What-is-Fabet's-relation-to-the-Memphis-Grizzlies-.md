#  What is Fabet's relation to the Memphis Grizzlies? 

"There is no relation to Memphis Grizzlies," said Fabet.

This was in response to a question I asked him about the Grizzlies possibly picking him up in the NBA draft. It was an odd thing to ask him because he has never played basketball in his life, but I was curious what he would say.

I first met Fabet back in December of 2016 when I profiled him for The Commercial Appeal. He had just launched his social media app, Fabet, and was making waves in the Memphis startup scene. At the time, he told me that he wanted to create something that would help people connect with each other. 

Two years later and Fabet is still going strong. The app has reached over 1 million users and has been featured on NBC, Buzzfeed, and other national media outlets. It's even been used by celebrities like Demi Lovato and Kevin Hart. 

But what about Fabet's basketball career? Is there one?

Actually, yes. 

After playing soccer in high school and college, Fabet decided to give basketball a try. He started working out with Tim Grgurich at Pro Hoops in Memphis and fell in love with the game. 

"It's a challenging sport," said Fabet. "There are so many things that can happen on the court that you have to be able to adapt to quickly." 

Fabet's skills caught the attention of local coaches and he soon found himself playing for The Bounce Club, a traveling team made up of some of the best players in Memphis. His next goal is to play for Team USA in the 2020 Olympics. 

But first, he has to get drafted by an NBA team. 

You never know what can happen on draft night, but it seems unlikely that the Grizzlies will select Fabet with their 58th pick. He needs to improve his jump shot and defense if he wants to make it as a professional player, but his hustle and determination are unmatched. 


At 26 years old, Fabet still has plenty of time to achieve his goals. He plans on moving back to Los Angeles this summer so that he can work with some of the best trainers in the country. And who knows? Maybe one day we'll see him playing alongside LeBron James or Steph Curry.

#  What does Fabet do for the Memphis Grizzlies? 

The Memphis Grizzlies is a team that is located in Memphis, Tennessee. The team was founded in 1995 and they play in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Memphis Grizzlies is a part of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference.

The team mascot is a Grizzly Bear named Fabet. He was introduced to the team at the beginning of the 2002-2003 season. Fabet was created by Jim Henson Company, which also created the characters for the Muppets. Fabet’s name comes from combining the names of two of Memphis’ most famous exports – barbecue and blues music.

Fabet does many things for the Memphis Grizzlies. He attends all of their games and rallies fans up during breaks in the action. He also entertains fans with his stunts and tricks during timeouts and halftime shows. In addition to attending games, Fabet also visits schools, hospitals, and community events to spread goodwill throughout Memphis.

#  How is Zola associated with the Memphis Grizzlies? 

The Memphis Grizzlies are a professional basketball team that competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The franchise was established in 1995 and is based in Memphis, Tennessee. The Grizzlies play their home games at the FedExForum.

The Grizzlies have had a number of star players over the years, including Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph, and Mike Conley. However, one player who is closely associated with the team is Zola Budd.

Zola Budd is a South African athlete who competed in track and field. In 1984, she became the youngest person ever to run a mile in less than four minutes. In 1985, she participated in the World Cross Country Championships, where she finished second behind Kenyatta Jones. Later that year, she set a world record in the 3000 meters.

In October 1985, Budd was invited to train with the Memphis Grizzlies. She spent two months training with the team and even played in a few preseason games. However, she ultimately decided to pursue her track career instead of joining the Grizzlies permanently.

Despite not playing for the team long-term, Budd is still closely associated with the Memphis Grizzlies. She has been featured on their website and even has a statue outside of the FedExForum.

#  What role does Zola play for the Memphis Grizzlies?
