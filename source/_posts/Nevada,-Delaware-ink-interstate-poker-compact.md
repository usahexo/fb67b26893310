#  Nevada, Delaware ink interstate poker compact

Nevada and Delaware have entered into a poker compact, which will allow players in both states to play against each other. The agreement is set to take effect on July 1, and will also see Nevada sharing its player data with Delaware.

The two states have been working on the deal for some time, and it was only given the go-ahead after the US Department of Justice issued a ruling that allowed for such agreements between states.

"This is great news for both players and operators in Nevada and Delaware," said Andrew Crosby, spokesman for the Interactive Gaming Council. "The agreement opens up new opportunities for players while providing a larger player pool and liquidity for operators."

The interstate poker compact is seen as a major step forward for online poker in the US, as it provides a model that could be replicated by other states in the future.

#  California readies online gambling regulations

The state of California is getting ready to regulate online gambling, in a move that could provide a much-needed revenue stream for the cash-strapped government and see some of the country's biggest gaming companies battle it out for supremacy in the industry.

Californian lawmakers are currently considering two draft bills, SB456 and AB1677, that would legalize, regulate and tax online gambling within the state borders. The proposals would allow for a wide range of games to be offered, including poker, blackjack and slots, and would give operators such as MGM Resorts, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts a chance to establish a footprint in what is expected to be a lucrative market.

The moves by California come as other states look to follow in the footsteps of Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey in legalizing internet gambling. However, regulators in those states have faced difficulty in drafting rules that adequately protect consumers while also ensuring that gaming companies can turn a profit. That has led some observers to suggest that California – which has more than enough players to justify an online gambling industry – may face similar problems.

"It's clear that there is interest in this space and we want to make sure we get this right for California," said Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer, who is backing the AB1677 proposal. "There are many questions that still need to be answered but I believe regulating and taxing internet poker will bring jobs and revenues to our state."

Online gambling is currently legal in three US states – Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey – with Pennsylvaniaexpected to join them later this year. In addition, there are a number of unlicensed offshore operators who offer their services to Americans. The market for online gambling is estimated to be worth $4.7 billion annually and is forecast to grow at a rate of 6% each year.

#  Online gambling legislation introduced in Connecticut

The state of Connecticut is looking to join the growing number of states that have regulated online gambling. The proposed legislation was introduced by state Rep. Robert Rankin on Thursday.

Rankin’s proposal would allow residents 21 years and older to gamble online, with the state taking a cut of the profits. The proposed bill also calls for casinos in Bridgeport and East Windsor to offer internet gambling services.

“Today, we are at the forefront of an industry that is expected to create thousands of jobs and generate millions of dollars in revenue for our state,” Rankin said in a statement.

Rankin’s legislation has been referred to the Judiciary Committee for further evaluation.

Supporters of online gambling argue that it can be a boon to the economy, while opponents claim it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. So far, 34 states have legalized some form of online gambling.

Connecticut is one of several states considering online gambling legislation this year. In February, New Jersey became the first state to authorize sports betting after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the practice.

#  Illinois, Iowa exploring online gambling

Governors of Illinois and Iowa have announced that their states are exploring the possibility of legalizing and regulating online gambling.

“We’ve been looking at this for quite some time, trying to figure out how it would work, what the benefits would be, what the drawbacks might be,” said Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker in a statement.

Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds added: “Iowans are already participating in illegal gambling on unregulated websites, so we must act now to bring this activity into the light and protect consumers.”

Both governors point to potential tax revenue as a key incentive for legalization. Illinois is estimating that it could bring in $160 million annually, while Iowa anticipates over $25 million in new revenue each year.

There is also interest in regulating online gambling as a way to combat illegal activity. Currently, there is no way to track illegal gambling activities, but legalizing and regulating the industry would give oversight to state authorities.

Regulating online gambling has its opponents, however. Some argue that it could lead to more addiction problems, and there are concerns about underage players being able to access games.

The move by Illinois and Iowa comes as other states are also considering legalizing online gambling. In December 2018, Michigan became the first state in the Midwest to legalize internet casino games. And last month, New York lawmakers introduced a bill that would legalize sports betting as well as online poker and casino games.

#  New Jersey nets $180 million in online gambling revenue

The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement released their Q1-2018 report which details the gross gaming revenue (GGR) generated from all forms of legalized gambling in the state. This includes casino gaming, horseracing, and online gambling. The total GGR for Q1-2018 was $180 million, up 2% year-over-year.

Online gambling continues to be a shining star for New Jersey, generating $37.9 million in GGR during the quarter. This is up 20% year-over-year and accounts for 21% of the state’s total GGR. Poker continues to be the most popular online gambling game, accounting for 41% of online gambling revenue.

The strong performance of online gambling has helped offset weakness in other areas of the New Jersey gaming market. Casino gaming GGR was down 3% year-over-year to $107 million, while horseracing GGR was down 9% to $16 million.
