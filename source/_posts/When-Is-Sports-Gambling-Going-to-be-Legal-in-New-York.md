#  When Is Sports Gambling Going to be Legal in New York?

The New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) is continuing to review the legalized sports gambling landscape in order to develop the best approach for New York. 

Legalized sports gambling is currently operational in five states: Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, and West Virginia. In addition, there are four other states that have passed legislation but have not yet gone live with their sportsbooks: Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Illinois, and Michigan. 

The main priorities for the NYSGC are consumer protection and ensuring the integrity of sporting events.

#  State Assembly Plans to Vote on Legalizing Sports Gambling in New York

The state Assembly in New York plans to vote on a bill that would legalize sports gambling in the state. If the bill is passed, it would allow for the construction of up to seven casinos that would offer sports betting. Gambling opponents argue that the bill amounts to “legalized gambling” and could lead to addiction problems, while supporters say that it would bring in much-needed revenue to the state.

The move to legalize sports betting in New York comes as more and more states are moving to allow it. In May, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited sports gambling, opening the door for states to pass their own laws on the matter. So far, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island have all legalized some form of sports betting.

Proponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it would be a boon to the economy, creating jobs and generating tax revenue. They also say that it would be a safe way for people to bet on sports, as regulations would ensure that games are fair and there is no cheating.

Opponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it is nothing more than a legalized form of gambling, which can lead to addiction problems. They also point out that many people who bet on sports lose money, so the state could end up losing revenue rather than gaining it.

#  Sports Betting on the Horizon for New York

There has been talk of legalizing sports betting in New York for years, and it looks like that may finally happen in 2019. Governor Andrew Cuomo is in favor of the move, as are many legislators, and proponents say that it could generate up to $300 million in annual revenue.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction and other social ills, but supporters say that such concerns can be addressed through regulation. They also point out that New York is already a big destination for illegal betting, so legalization would at least bring some money into the state coffers.

If the legislation is passed, it's not yet clear how sports betting would be implemented. There are a few options on the table, including authorizing existing Native American casinos to offer sports betting, or setting up a new regulatory body to oversee wagering.

In any case, there would likely be a delay before sports betting actually becomes available in New York. The state would need to draft regulations and award licenses to operators, so it's likely that we won't see anything until 2020 at the earliest.

Even so, there's already been a lot of interest in sports betting from both consumers and businesses. Several major casino companies have already announced plans to offer sports betting if it becomes legal, and there's no doubt that there will be plenty of competition among operators once the market opens up.

#  What's the Hold Up? Why Hasn't Sports Gambling Been Legalized in New York Yet?

A few weeks ago, there was a lot of hubbub when it looked like sports gambling was about to be legalized in New York. The state Assembly had passed a bill that would allow it, and Governor Andrew Cuomo was on board.

But then things changed.

Suddenly, the push to legalize sports gambling in New York has stalled, and no one seems to know why. Cuomo hasn't given a clear explanation for why he's changed his position, and the people behind the bill say they're just as in the dark as everyone else.

So what's going on? Why has legalizing sports gambling in New York hit a roadblock?

There are a few possible explanations.

One is that Cuomo is worried about the impact legalization will have on the state's casinos. Casinos are a big industry in New York, and Cuomo may not want to see them lose business to sports gambling venues.

Another possibility is that Cuomo is waiting for the Supreme Court to rule on the legality of sports gambling before he takes any action. The high court is expected to issue its ruling in the spring, and Cuomo may be waiting to see what it says before making a decision.

Whatever the reason, it's been frustrating for proponents of legalization who were hoping for a quick resolution. And with the legislative session coming to an end in June, there's not much time left for things to move forward.

#  Legal Sports Betting Could be Coming Soon to New York

After a few years of unsuccessfully trying to legalize sports betting in New York, state lawmakers are finally close to a deal that would allow it.

According to multiple reports, the state Assembly and Senate have reached an agreement on a bill that would legalize sports betting. The bill would give the New York State Gaming Commission the power to regulate and tax sports betting.

It’s unclear when the bill will be voted on, but lawmakers say they’re confident it will pass.

This is great news for New Yorkers, who have been eager to get their hands on legal sports betting. Polls show that a majority of residents support legalizing sports betting, and lawmakers have been under pressure to act.

Legalizing sports betting would bring in much-needed revenue for the state. It could also create jobs and help tourism.

There’s no word yet on when sports betting will be legalized, but it seems likely that it will happen soon. Stay tuned for updates!
