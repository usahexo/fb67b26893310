#  Which Slot Machine has the Best Payouts at San Manuel Casino?

The thrill of watching those reels spin round and round is what keeps many people coming back to slot machines. But, if you're looking for the best payout, which slot machine should you choose?

There are a few things to take into account when trying to determine the payout of a slot machine. Firstly, there is the RTP, or return to player percentage. This measures how much of the money put in by players is paid out as prizes. In general, the higher the RTP, the better the payout. You can find this information in most casino brochures or on their websites.

Secondly, you need to look at the individual game's payout table. This will tell you how much each winning combination pays out and what the minimum and maximum bets are. Remember that not all games have the same payout table - so it's important to do your research before playing.

Finally, don't forget about jackpots! Some slot machines offer smaller payouts but with the chance of hitting a much bigger jackpot. So if you're looking for a big win, be sure to factor in jackpots when choosing your game.
