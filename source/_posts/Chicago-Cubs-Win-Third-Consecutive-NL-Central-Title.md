#  Chicago Cubs Win Third Consecutive NL Central Title

The Chicago Cubs became the first team in the National League to clinch a playoff berth, winning their third consecutive NL Central title on September 20. The Cubs are now one step closer to achieving their goal of breaking the 108-year championship drought.

To secure their playoff berth, the Cubs beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 10-2 on September 20. This was their 104th win of the season, setting a new franchise record. Their previous record of 103 wins was set in 1908, the year they won their last championship.

The Cubs have been on an amazing run this season, and they show no signs of slowing down. They are currently leading the NL Central with a 7.5 game lead over the second place Milwaukee Brewers. They also have the best record in baseball with a 99-56 record.

One of the keys to their success has been their strong pitching staff. Led by ace pitcher Jake Arrieta, the Cubs’ pitching staff has posted a 3.11 ERA this season, which is fifth best in baseball.

In addition to their pitching staff, the Cubs also have a potent lineup led by MVP candidate Kris Bryant. Bryant is batting .290 with 39 home runs and 101 RBIs this season. Other key hitters include Anthony Rizzo (.292 batting average, 32 home runs, 109 RBIs) and Javier Baez (.273 batting average, 23 home runs, 75 RBIs).

With such a powerful lineup and dominant pitching staff, it is no surprise that the Chicago Cubs are poised to make a deep run in the playoffs. If they can continue to play at this high level, there is no doubt that they will finally be able to break their 108-year championship drought and bring home a World Series Championship trophy to Chicago.

#  Star Third Baseman Kris Bryant Wins MVP

Kris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs is the unanimous National League MVP for the 2016 season. This is his first MVP award.

Bryant, 25, led the league in several categories, including batting average (.292), on-base percentage (.385), slugging percentage (.553), and runs scored (122). He also finished in the top five in home runs (39) and RBIs (121).

A third baseman by trade, Bryant played a different position in nearly every game this year due to injuries on the Cubs roster. He appeared in 92 games at third base, 36 games in right field, and 21 games at first base.

"It's been an interesting season," said Bryant. "I'm just glad I could help my team win games."

The Cubs finished the season with a record of 103-58, winning the National League Central Division title. They went on to win their first World Series championship since 1908.

#  Jake Arrieta Named Cy Young Winner After Historic Season

It was a season for the ages for Jake Arrieta. The Chicago Cubs pitcher was named the National League Cy Young Award winner on Wednesday night, becoming just the sixth pitcher in history to win the award in both leagues.

Arrieta led all major league pitchers with 22 wins and posted a 1.77 ERA, the lowest mark in baseball since Pedro Martinez's 1995 season. He also set a major league record by winning his last 16 decisions of the season.

"It's been an incredible season," Arrieta said after accepting his award. "I'm so grateful for my teammates, my coaches, my family and everyone who has helped me achieve this."

The Cubs ace was not heavily favored to win the Cy Young Award at the start of the season, but he quickly emerged as one of the best pitchers in baseball. In September, he went 5-0 with a 0.75 ERA and was a key reason why the Cubs won their first division title in seven years.

Arrieta is now just the fourth pitcher in Cubs history to win a Cy Young Award, joining Bruce Sutter (1977), Rick Sutcliffe (1984) and Greg Maddux (1992).

#  Joe Maddon Named Manager Of The Year 

In a season that saw the Chicago Cubs break their 108-year long championship drought, Joe Maddon was named manager of the year by the Baseball Writers Association of America.

Maddon, who is in his third year managing the Cubs, led the team to a 103-58 record and their first World Series title since 1908. Maddon’s defensive shifts and reliance on analytics helped the Cubs become one of the best teams in baseball, and he was rewarded for it with the manager of the year trophy.

Other nominees for manager of the year included Dusty Baker of the Washington Nationals, Terry Francona of the Cleveland Indians, and Dave Roberts of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

#  Chicago Cubs Set To Defend Their World Series Title

The Chicago Cubs are looking to defend their World Series title in 2017. They have a very talented squad and should be one of the favorites to win the championship.

The Cubs had an impressive season in 2016, finishing with the best record in baseball. They then went on to win the World Series, defeating the Cleveland Indians in seven games.

The Cubs will be led by a talented group of players, including Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo, Javier Baez and Addison Russell. They will be looking to carry over their success from last season into this year.

Chicago also has a strong pitching staff, led by Jon Lester, Jake Arrieta and Kyle Hendricks. They should be able to contend with any team in the league.

The Cubs are definitely contenders for the World Series title this year and should be one of the top teams in baseball.
