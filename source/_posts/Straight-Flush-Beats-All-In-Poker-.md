#  Straight Flush Beats All In Poker 

In poker, there are numerous different hands that can be dealt, each with its own likelihood of occurring. When two players have comparable hands, the outcome is often determined by a process called "flopping", in which the players reveal their hole cards and the player with the best five-card combination using any combination of their hole cards and the community cards wins. 

However, there are a few situations in which one hand beats all others, even if it is not the best five-card combination. This is known as a "straight flush". A straight flush is a hand that consists of five consecutive card of the same suit. In other words, it is a hand that contains five cards in order, such as 2♥ 3♣ 4♦ 5♥.

If two players have straight flushes, the player with the highest-ranking card wins. So, for example, if one player has a nine high straight flush and another player has an ace high straight flush, the player with the ace high straight flush would win. If both players have the same high card, then the next highest card would determine the winner. And so on... 

Since a straight flush beats all other possible hands in poker, it is important to know how to recognize one when it occurs. Typically, a straight flush will be accompanied by an extremely excited player who cannot control his or her emotions. This is because a straight flush is such a rare occurrence; most poker games will not see more than one or two in an entire evening of play. 

When you do see a straight flush at the poker table, remember toCongratulations to the lucky player!

#  Royal flush still holds the power in poker 

TexasHoldem, Omaha, Stud and other poker variants are all enjoyed for one common goal - to win money. In any given hand, there is a winner and a loser, but some hands are more prestigious than others. The Royal flush is the highest ranking hand in poker, and it still holds a great deal of power even in the current game environment.

A Royal flush typically consists of ace-king-queen-jack-ten of the same suit. This hand is extremely rare, and typically only happens once or twice per thousand hands. As a result, when it does hit, it often results in a big payout for the player holding it. Even in games with relatively low stakes, a Royal flush can often be worth several hundred dollars.

In addition to the payoff potential, a Royal flush also has a lot of prestige associated with it. It is considered the "holy grail" of poker hands, and rightly so - no other combination can beat it. Players who are able to reel off this hand are considered to be true masters of the game, and often receive a good deal of respect from their peers.

So while other combinations may come and go in terms of value and power, the Royal flush will always be king when it comes to poker hands.

#  Aces still high in poker hands rankings 

Despite the popular perception that modern poker is all about huge hands like four of a kind or better, the truth is that aces are still king. In fact, hands containing an ace rank first in almost all poker probability rankings.

A study of over two million online poker hands reveals that ace-high hands account for nearly one-third of all winning hands. This makes sense when you consider that aces are both high and powerful, and can be played in a number of ways to create strong potential hands.

In second place among winning poker hands comes pocket pairs (two specific cards of the same rank), followed by three of a kind. These three combinations account for more than 50 percent of all winning hands, underscoring the importance of starting with a strong hand in today’s modern poker games.

Interestingly, while four of a kind and full houses remain powerful hands, they only account for around 10 percent of all winning combinations. This means that if you are looking to win at poker, you need to be aware not just of the big hands, but also of the many opportunities available with strong ace and pair combinations.
