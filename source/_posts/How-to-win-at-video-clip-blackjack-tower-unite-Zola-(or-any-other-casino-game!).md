#  So you want to be a millionaire? Learn how to play video clip blackjack tower unite Zola like a pro!

Video clip blackjack is a great way to make some quick millionaires. But if you're new to the game, it can be daunting to know where to start. So we're here to help! In this article, we'll teach you the basics of video clip blackjack and how to play like a pro.

First off, let's take a look at the basic rules of video clip blackjack:

- The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over.

- You can hit (draw another card) or stand (take no more cards).

- If you go over 21, you bust and lose automatically.

- The dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17.

So how do you win? Simply put, by getting closer to 21 than the dealer without busting. If both you and the dealer have 21, or if the dealer busts, it's a draw and no one wins or loses money.

The most important thing when playing blackjack is knowing when to hit and when to stand. Generally speaking, you should always hit if your hand is below 17 and stand if your hand is 17 or above. But there are exceptions to this rule, so it's important to understand the different situations that can arise during a game of blackjack. For example, if you have an Ace and a 10 (total value of 21), you should stand even if your hand is only 11 or 12 because it's very unlikely that the dealer will have a higher total than that. Conversely, if you have an 8 and a 3 (total value of 11), you should always hit because there's a good chance that the dealer has a higher total than that. And remember - never bust!
