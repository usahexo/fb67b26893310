But what about the drinks? Royal Caribbean's casinos offer free cocktails to players. This includes cocktails from the ship's bar as well as specialty cocktails from the casino bar. There's no need to purchase any drink coupons or points; just sit down at a table and start playing.

Of course, the casino isn't just for gamblers. It's also a great place to watch sporting events or listen to live music. And with free drinks available, it's easy to relax and enjoy yourself whether you're playing or not.

So if you're looking for something fun to do on your next cruise, be sure to check out the Royal Caribbean casino. You may end up winning big – but even if you don't, you'll still have a blast and get free drinks along the way!

#  How Much Do I Have to Devote in Royal Caribbean Casino In Order to Get Free Drinks? 

Royal Caribbean casinos offer drinks to players, but how much do you have to gamble in order to qualify for free drinks? This article will explore the casino drink policy and what is required of passengers in order to get free drinks while playing.

First and foremost, passengers must be of legal drinking age in order to enjoy free beverages while gambling in the Royal Caribbean casinos. Secondly, passengers must either have a Players Club card or sign up for one at the casino cashier window. The Players Club is free to join and offers many benefits, including complimentary drinks while gambling. 

Once a passenger has joined the Players Club, they are automatically eligible for free non-alcoholic beverages while playing any casino game. If alcoholic beverages are desired, a passenger must earn points by gambling. For every $10 spent on games such as slots, blackjack, roulette, and craps, a passenger earns one point. Once a passenger accumulates 100 points, they may exchange those points for a complimentary alcoholic drink at the casino bar. 

It’s important to note that there are some restrictions on what type of alcohol can be redeemed with points. Beer and wine are typically available at the casino bars, but harder liquors may not be. Also, certain brands and types of alcohol may not be available depending on the cruise ship and its itinerary. 

So, how much do you have to gamble in Royal Caribbean casinos in order to get free drinks? It depends on what type of drink is desired, but typically around $100 worth of gaming will earn a passenger enough points for one complimentary alcoholic beverage. And remember - there is no purchase necessary to join the Royal Caribbean Players Club!
