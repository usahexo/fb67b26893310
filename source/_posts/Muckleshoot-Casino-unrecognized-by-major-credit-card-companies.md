#  Muckleshoot Casino unrecognized by major credit card companies

Muckleshoot Casino in Auburn, Washington is currently unrecognized by all of the major credit card companies. This means that customers of the casino cannot use their major credit cards to make deposits or withdrawals.

This problem first came to light in July of 2017, when several customers took to social media to express their frustration with the situation. Many people were concerned that they would not be able to access their winnings from the casino.

At the time, a spokesperson for Muckleshoot Casino said that the issue was being investigated and that a solution was imminent. However, more than six months later, the casino still does not accept major credit cards.

In the meantime, customers are forced to find other ways to make deposits and withdrawals at Muckleshoot Casino. Some people have turned to online payment processors such as PayPal and Venmo, while others have resorted to using cash or check.

It is unclear why Muckleshoot Casino has not been able to resolve this issue with the major credit card companies. It is possible that there is a dispute over fees or that the casino is not meeting certain security requirements.

Whatever the reason may be, it is clear that this problem is causing inconvenience for many customers. Hopefully, a resolution can be reached soon so that everyone can enjoy all that Muckleshoot Casino has to offer.

#  Muckleshoot Casino a hub for illegal gambling activity

Muckleshoot Casino in Auburn, Washington is a hot spot for illegal gambling activity, according to law enforcement. In recent months, the casino has been raided by police officers investigating illegal gambling rings.

One of the most recent raids occurred in March, when officers seized $30,000 in cash and arrested two people on suspicion of running an illegal gambling ring. The raid was part of an ongoing investigation into a large-scale gambling operation that was allegedly taking place at the casino.

According to investigators, the suspects were using Muckleshoot Casino as their base of operations for illegal gambling activities. They would allegedly bring large sums of cash to the casino and place bets on sporting events, then pay out winnings with more cash.

This is not the first time that Muckleshoot Casino has been linked to illegal gambling activity. In 2013, the casino was raided as part of a crackdown on an interstate gambling ring. Police seized more than $100,000 in cash and arrested several people involved in the ring.

Law enforcement officials say that Muckleshoot Casino is a popular destination for illegal gamblers because it offers a wide variety of gaming options, including blackjack, poker and craps. The casino also has a high limit area where players can place bets of up to $500 per hand.

#  Muckleshoot Casino fined for environmental violations

The Muckleshoot Casino has been fined for environmental violations after failing to properly contain wastewater.

According to the <a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/State-fines-Muckleshoot-Casino-for-environmental-13732708.php">Seattle Times</a>, the casino was fined $35,000 for allowing untreated wastewater to flow into a storm drain that empties into Muckleshoot Creek.

The state Department of Ecology issued the fine after an inspection in November found that the casino was not meeting its permit requirements to properly contain wastewater.

In a statement, the department said, "<a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/State-fines-Muckleshoot-Casino-for-environmental-13732708.php">"This is not acceptable from any regulated entity."</a>"

The casino has since taken steps to address the issue, including installing a new drainage system and developing a plan to treat all of its wastewater.

The Muckleshoot Casino is not the only business in Washington state to be fined for environmental violations in recent months. In <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/ whistling-duck-farmersmarket-included-innerspace-developments/" target="_blank">December</a>, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/ whistling-duck-farmersmarket-included-innerspace-developments/" target="_blank">Innerspace Development</a> was fined $7,000 for polluting Phinney Bay with sediment from a construction site.
