#  When To Do Insurance About Blackjack Durrenm: Don't Miss Out!

In almost all casinos, blackjack is the most popular table game. Blackjack pits player against dealer in a contest to see who can score closest to 21 points without going over. Winning payouts are based on the point total of the player's hand, with a bonus payout for a blackjack (an ace and any ten-point card).

Casinos have rules in place that set out when player insurance must be taken. The most common rule is that when the first two cards in the player's hand are an ace and a ten-point card (a blackjack), then the player is offered insurance. If the player declines the offer of insurance, then they immediately forfeit any chance at winning a bonus payout for having a blackjack. However, if they accept the offer of insurance, their original bet is placed into a side pot. If the dealer then subsequently receives a blackjack (any Ace plus any other ten-point card), then the player's bet is paid out at 2:1 odds, while the side pot is won by the dealer. 

There are variations on this rule, with some casinos offering insurance even when the first two cards are not an Ace and ten-point card. So long as you know what these rules are before you start playing, you can make an informed decision about whether or not to take insurance when it's offered to you.

#  You Won't Believe What Happens When You Don't Do Insurance About Blackjack Durrenm



As an avid blackjack player, you may be wondering if insurance is really worth it. After all, the house edge for insurance is about 2.5% – much higher than blackjack proper. So, is it worth it to take out insurance when playing blackjack?

The answer to this question largely depends on the casino you're playing at. If the casino offers a rule known as surrender, then insurance becomes much more valuable. Under this rule, players are allowed to give up their hand and receive half of their original bet back – as long as the dealer has a natural (or blackjack). In this case, insurance can be seen as a type of hedge; by taking out insurance, you're essentially protecting yourself against the possibility of the dealer having a natural.

If your casino doesn't offer surrender, then insurance isn't nearly as valuable. In this case, you're better off simply betting on your own hand and skipping the insurance altogether. After all, the house edge for blackjack without insurance is only 0.5%, making it a much better option in most cases.

#  Why You Need To Do Insurance About Blackjack Durrenm

The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer by collecting cards with a value that's nearer 21 as opposed to that of the dealer, without busting (exceeding 21). It's a game of chance and skill. You need to do some homework first so you might make informed decisions while enjoying playing. Take a look at our blackjack insurance guide below.

## The Basics
The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer by collecting cards with a value that's nearer 21 as opposed to that of the dealer, without busting (exceeding 21). The game is played with 1 or more decks of 52 cards. Aces can be counted as 1 or 11 points, 2-10 are counted as face value, and a Jack, Queen or King are counted as 10 points. After the player has been dealt their initial 2 cards, they've got 3 choices:

*Take another card - This is known as "drawing cards" and will continue until you either bust or decide to stop drawing. When you opt for this choice, the dealer also gets another card face up.*Stand - If you're happy with your hand total (i.e. it isn't bust), you can choose to stand and receive no further cards.*Hit - If you want another card in order to try and improve your hand, hit and take one card at a time until you either bust or decide to stand.

If neither you nor the dealer have busted by taking extra cards and your card totals are the same, this is called a "push" and your stake is refunded.

## Insurance in Blackjack

   One interesting option available to blackjack players is insurance. When the dealer has an Ace showing, they will offer insurance to players. This is basically a side bet whereby players can bet up to half their original stake that the dealer has blackjack (an Ace and 10-point card).    Should the dealer have blackjack, those players who have placed an insurance bet win 2-1 on their investment. However, should the dealer not have blackjack (ace only), then players lose their insurance bet just like any other side bet would be lost in blackjack.   So why do some people choose to take insurance? Essentially, because it's a 50/50 bet - it's just like flipping a coin! Many experienced blackjack players will avoid taking insurance altogether as they feel that it's simply not worth the risk when there's such good odds of losing. Others see it as another way of making money when playing blackjack - especially if they're table has decent odds on offer for taking insurance bets (around 2%).


So should you take insurance when playingblackjack? That depends on your own personal strategy and how comfortableyou feel with risking part of your staked money on this side bet. Some people swear by takinginsurance when playing; others never touch it!

#  The Best Time To Do Insurance About Blackjack Durrenm



There is no one definitive answer to the question of when the best time to do insurance about blackjack is, as it depends on a variety of factors. However, there are some guidelines you can follow to help make the decision for yourself. In this article, we'll explore what those factors are and how you can use them to make the best decision for your individual game.

One of the most important things to consider when deciding whether or not to take insurance is your bankroll. How much money do you have available to you for gambling? If you only have a limited amount of money to play with, it might not be wise to risk it all on insurance – especially if the chances of losing are high.

Another thing to consider is your playing style. Some players like to take risks and go all-in, while others prefer to play more conservatively. If you're someone who likes to take risks, then insurance might be a good option for you – but only if you're comfortable with the potential consequences. Conversely, if you're more conservative in your play style, then it might be wise to avoid insurance altogether.

Your odds of winning also play a role in your decision making process. The odds of winning with insurance are generally about 50/50 – which means that you have a decent chance of breaking even or even making a small profit if you bet correctly. However, if your odds of winning without insurance are significantly better than 50/50, then it might not be worth taking the risk.

In the end, the best time to do insurance about blackjack is really up to you. There are no hard and fast rules that apply in every situation; instead, it's important to look at all the relevant factors and make a decision based on what's best for you. Sooner or later, you'll find yourself in a situation where insurance is the right call – so be sure to stay informed and make the right decision when the time comes!
