      		<h1 id="Get-to-Know-the-Pittsburgh-Pirates"><a href="#Get-to-Know-the-Pittsburgh-Pirates" class="headerlink" title="Get to Know the Pittsburgh Pirates"></a>Get to Know the Pittsburgh Pirates</h1><p>The Pittsburgh Pirates are a professional baseball team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pirates compete in the National League (NL) Central division.</p>
<p>The Pirates play their home games at PNC Park, which opened in 2001. The Pirates have qualified for the playoffs six times and played in the National League Championship Series three times. Their best result was coming within one game of winning the World Series on two separate occasions.</p>
<p>The current manager is Clint Hurdle, who took over the managerial role prior to the 2011 season.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into two leagues: the National League and American League. Each league is then divided into three divisions: East, West, and Central. The Pirates are in the National League Central division.</p>
<p>The Pirates have had a number of star players over the years, including Willie Stargell, Roberto Clemente, Barry Bonds, and Andrew McCutchen.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Pirates were founded on October 15th, 1881 as part of the American Association (AA). The team joined the National League (NL) as an expansion team in 1887.</p>
<p>The first game in franchise history was played on April 22nd, 1882 against the Allegheny club from Philadelphia. The Pirates lost that game 8-0.</p>
<p>In their early years, the Pirates were often called “the Pittsburghees” or simply “the Pittsburghers”. They officially shortened their name to “Pirates” in 1912.</p>
<h1 id="Variety-is-the-Key-to-Successful-Activities-Betting-on-the-Pittsburgh-Pirates"><a href="#Variety-is-the-Key-to-Successful-Activities-Betting-on-the-Pittsburgh-Pirates" class="headerlink" title="Variety is the Key to Successful Activities Betting on the Pittsburgh Pirates"></a>Variety is the Key to Successful Activities Betting on the Pittsburgh Pirates</h1><p>Pittsburgh Pirates fans know that variety is the key to keeping their baseball interests alive all season long. The Pirates have had an interesting mix of young and old players this year, which has resulted in a lot of winning and losing streaks.</p>
<p>The team started off the season strong, going 11-8 in their first 19 games. However, they then went on a 10-game losing streak, which put them in a bad spot. They were able to pull themselves out of it with a six-game winning streak, but then lost four out of their next six games.</p>
<p>This inconsistency is what makes the Pirates so difficult to predict. Will they continue to win or will they fall back into another losing streak? This is why following the Pirates can be so exciting for fans – you never know what’s going to happen!</p>
<p>Some people may think that this variability would be a disadvantage for the team, but it’s actually been one of their strengths this season. Their ability to win big and lose big means that they always have something to play for. No matter what their record is, there’s always a chance they could make a comeback and make the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Pirates are currently in third place in the National League Central Division with a record of 58-53. If they can stay consistent for the rest of the season, they have a good chance of making it to the playoffs. However, if they start losing again, they could easily fall out of contention.</p>
<p>What’s most important for the team right now is to stay focused and not get discouraged by their losses. This is easier said than done, but if they can do it, they have a good chance of making it far into the playoffs. Variety may be the key to success for the Pittsburgh Pirates, but only time will tell if that remains true for the rest of the season!</p>
<h1 id="Stats-and-Trends-to-Consider-Before-Betting-on-the-Pirates"><a href="#Stats-and-Trends-to-Consider-Before-Betting-on-the-Pirates" class="headerlink" title="Stats and Trends to Consider Before Betting on the Pirates"></a>Stats and Trends to Consider Before Betting on the Pirates</h1><p>The Pittsburgh Pirates have had a great season so far and are currently in 2nd place in the NL Central. However, there are a few stats and trends to consider before betting on the Pirates.</p>
<p>First of all, the Pirates have been very good at home but have not been as successful on the road. This is likely due to their weak pitching staff, which ranks 23rd in ERA. In contrast, their offense ranks 5th in runs scored.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that the Pirates tend to score a lot of runs in the first inning. They have scored the most runs in the first inning this season (86), which is significantly more than any other team. This could be a sign that they are getting off to a good start and are likely to win the game.</p>
<p>Finally, the Pirates have been very streaky this season. They have had several long winning streaks (7 games, 9 games, and 11 games), as well as several long losing streaks (5 games, 6 games, and 7 games). This means that it is important to carefully track their current form before betting on them.</p>
<h1 id="Reviewing-the-Early-Season-Record-of-the-Pittsburgh-Pirates"><a href="#Reviewing-the-Early-Season-Record-of-the-Pittsburgh-Pirates" class="headerlink" title="Reviewing the Early Season Record of the Pittsburgh Pirates"></a>Reviewing the Early Season Record of the Pittsburgh Pirates</h1><p>To say the Pittsburgh Pirates got out to a hot start would be an understatement. They currently sit at 28-17, first in the NL Central, and showing few signs of slowing down. The offense has been clutch, as evidenced by their .282 batting average with runners in scoring position (8th in MLB), and the pitching staff has been solid all around.</p>
<p>The starting rotation has been anchored by ace Gerrit Cole, who is having another stellar season. He is 6-2 with a 2.78 ERA and 1.02 WHIP, striking out 109 batters in 86 innings pitched. Francisco Liriano has also been great, going 5-2 with a 3.06 ERA and 1.15 WHIP. Jeff Locke and Charlie Morton have each struggled at times but have also shown flashes of brilliance. The bullpen has been shaky at times but overall been fairly reliable, led by Mark Melancon’s 13 saves.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest reason for the Pirates’ success this season has been their team defense; they currently rank 4th in MLB in defensive efficiency (.694). They have also been very opportunistic on offense, ranking 5th in MLB in stolen bases (41) and 7th in hits (416).</p>
<p>All in all, it’s been an impressive start to the season for the Pirates. If they can continue to play well defensively and get timely hitting from their offense, they should be able to maintain their lead in the NL Central race and make a return trip to the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="The-Best-Way-to-Win-at-Activities-Betting-on-the-Pittsburgh-Pirates"><a href="#The-Best-Way-to-Win-at-Activities-Betting-on-the-Pittsburgh-Pirates" class="headerlink" title="The Best Way to Win at Activities Betting on the Pittsburgh Pirates"></a>The Best Way to Win at Activities Betting on the Pittsburgh Pirates</h1><p>There are a variety of ways to make money betting on sports, but among the most enjoyable - and potentially profitable - is activity betting. Wagering on the Proceedings of congress, whether or not Lionel Messi will score another hat-trick, or if the Cleveland Cavaliers can cover the spread is all exciting and interesting.</p>
<p>But what about activities betting on the Pittsburgh Pirates?</p>
<p>The Pirates had a dismal season in 2017, finishing with a record of 78-83 and 25 games behind the division-winning Chicago Cubs. That said, they were much more competitive towards the end of the year, going 34-36 after the All-Star break. And there are plenty of reasons to believe that they can build off of that momentum in 2018.</p>
<p>The first reason to be bullish on the Pirates this year is their starting rotation. They have one of the best young pitchers in baseball in right-hander Gerrit Cole, who went 12-12 with a 4.26 ERA last year. He’s joined by Ivan Nova (14-8, 3.21 ERA), Jameson Taillon (10-9, 3.38 ERA), Chad Kuhl (9-12, 4.20 ERA), and Trevor Williams (7-9, 4.07 ERA). That’s a solid rotation top to bottom, and it’s only going to get better as Taillon and Kuhl continue to develop.</p>
<p>The Pirates also have one of the best outfields in baseball anchored by Starling Marte and Gregory Polanco. Marte hit .312 with 19 homers and 81 RBI last year while Polanco hit .275 with 22 homers and 86 RBI. They’re both good hitters who should continue to improve in 2018.</p>
<p>Finally, the Pirates have an underrated manager in Clint Hurdle. He’s been at the helm since 2011 and has led them to three playoff appearances (including two Wild Card berths). He knows how to win games and gets the most out of his players - something that could come into play down the stretch this year.</p>
<p>So overall, there are plenty of reasons to think that the Pittsburgh Pirates will have a much better season in 2018 than they did last year. And that makes them an attractive team to bet on for activities purposes this year.</p>
