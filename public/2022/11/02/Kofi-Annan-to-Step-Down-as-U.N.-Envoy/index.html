Envoy"></a>Kofi Annan to Step Down as U.N. Envoy</h1><p>The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, announced on Thursday that he would step down from his post at the end of the year.</p>
<p>In a statement released by his office, Mr. Annan said he was making the decision for personal reasons and praised the United Nations for making &#96;&#96;tremendous progress’’ during his two terms as secretary-general.</p>
<p><code>I am deeply proud of what we have achieved,&#39;&#39; Mr. Annan said. </code>But I believe that it is time for me to leave office and allow someone else to take up this important challenge.’’</p>
<p>Mr. Annan has been buffeted by one crisis after another since he took office in 1997, including the war in Iraq, the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina and the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>Many analysts say that Mr. Annan’s most serious failure was his inability to reform the United Nations bureaucracy or to broker a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Syria.</p>
<h1 id="Ban-Ki-moon-Tapped-as-Next-U-N-Secretary-General"><a href="#Ban-Ki-moon-Tapped-as-Next-U-N-Secretary-General" class="headerlink" title="Ban Ki-moon Tapped as Next U.N. Secretary-General"></a>Ban Ki-moon Tapped as Next U.N. Secretary-General</h1><p><em>Ban Ki-moon, the former Foreign Minister of South Korea, has been selected as the next United Nations (U.N.) Secretary-General.</em></p>
<p>The <em>selection was made by the U.N.’s Security Council on Tuesday, October 5th</em>. Ban Ki-moon will succeed Kofi Annan when his term expires at the end of this year.</p>
<p>Ban Ki-moon has been a diplomat for South Korea since 1971. He has served as Foreign Minister since 2004. As U.N. Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon will be responsible for guiding the organization through some of its most pressing issues, including the global war on terror and the conflict in Iraq.</p>
<h1 id="Annan-Under-Fire-for-Iraqi-Oil-for-Food-Program"><a href="#Annan-Under-Fire-for-Iraqi-Oil-for-Food-Program" class="headerlink" title="Annan Under Fire for Iraqi Oil-for-Food Program"></a>Annan Under Fire for Iraqi Oil-for-Food Program</h1><p>Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been harshly criticized by a U.N. panel for his management of the Iraq oil-for-food program. The scathing report, released on Wednesday, states that Annan and his top aides were guilty of “gross negligence” in their oversight of the $64 billion humanitarian operation.</p>
<p>The Oil-for-Food program was created in 1996 as a way to allow Iraq to sell oil in order to buy food and medicine for its people, who were suffering under U.N. sanctions. However, the program was rife with corruption, and many people believe that Saddam Hussein and his associates used it to enrich themselves.</p>
<p>In its report, the U.N. panel said that Annan and his deputies failed to properly investigate allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the program. They also accused Annan of violating U.N. conflict-of-interest rules by failing to disclose that his son had received payments from a Swiss company that did business with Iraq.</p>
<p>Annan has strongly denied any wrongdoing, and he insists that he will not step down from his position as secretary-general. He has characterized the report as “flawed” and has promised to make changes to the way the United Nations operates its humanitarian operations.</p>
<h1 id="U-N-Chief-Kofi-Annan-Resigns"><a href="#U-N-Chief-Kofi-Annan-Resigns" class="headerlink" title="U.N. Chief Kofi Annan Resigns"></a>U.N. Chief Kofi Annan Resigns</h1><p>Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, announced his resignation today, effective at the end of this year.</p>
<p>“It has been a great honor and privilege to serve as secretary-general of the United Nations,” Mr. Annan said in a statement. “I am very grateful that the United Nations member states have given me this opportunity to serve.”</p>
<p>He did not give a reason for his decision, but it is believed that he is stepping down because of the organization’s failure to stop the bloodshed in Iraq and the sexual-abuse scandal in the Balkans.</p>
<p>Mr. Annan took office in 1997 as the first secretary-general from Africa and quickly became one of the most popular and well-known officials at the United Nations. He was praised for his efforts to reform the organization and to improve its image.</p>
<p>But in recent years he has come under criticism for being ineffective in dealing with major crises. In particular, many people have faulted him for not doing more to halt the violence in Iraq.</p>
<p>In February, Mr. Annan presented a report on the situation in Iraq that was highly critical of the United States and its allies for their role in toppling Saddam Hussein without sufficient planning for postwar reconstruction. The report provoked a strong reaction from President Bush and other American officials.</p>
<h1 id="Former-U-N-Chief-Kofi-Annan-Dies-at-80"><a href="#Former-U-N-Chief-Kofi-Annan-Dies-at-80" class="headerlink" title="Former U.N. Chief Kofi Annan Dies at 80"></a>Former U.N. Chief Kofi Annan Dies at 80</h1><p>Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary-general who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, has died at 80.</p>
<p>The announcement of his death was made Saturday by his foundation, which said he had passed away after a short illness.</p>
<p>“Kofi Annan was a global statesman and a deeply committed internationalist who fought throughout his life for a fairer and more peaceful world,” the foundation said in a statement. “He was an ardent champion of human rights and dignity, and helped shape the world we live in today.” </p>
<p>After rising through the ranks of the UN, Annan was appointed secretary-general in 1997, becoming the first African to hold the post. He served two terms, stepping down in 2006. </p>
<p>Annan drew criticism during his time as UN chief for what many saw as a sluggish response to the genocide in Rwanda and to the Iraq war. He later acknowledged that he should have done more to prevent both disasters. </p>
<p>But he was also widely praised for his efforts to reform the UN and to promote human rights. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001 “for work towards a better organized and more peaceful world.” </p>
<p>After leaving the UN, Annan founded the Kofi Annan Foundation, which focuses on global health, climate change, peacebuilding and women’s empowerment. </p>
<p>Tributes poured in from around the world following news of his death. </p>
<p>“Kofi Annan changed the course of many lives,” said former U.S. president Bill Clinton. “And he did so with good humor, kindness and deep commitment to human dignity.” </p>
